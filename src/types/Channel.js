 * Channel Types
 *
 * This module defines the unified message format and channel-related types
 * used across all communication channels in the Communexus platform.
 *
 * The UnifiedMessage interface provides a consistent format for messages
 * regardless of their source channel (SMS, Messenger, Email, In-App).
 * This enables the core messaging logic to work uniformly across all channels.
