2. **T008-T016**: Fix Firebase configuration and Appium tests
3. **T017-T031**: Implement notification system
4. **T032-T045**: Implement thread management
5. **T046-T050**: Complete cross-platform testing
6. **T051-T063**: Final validation and documentation

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 3.5.3**: Notification tasks T022-T027 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3.5.4**: Thread management tasks T036-T041 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3.5.7**: All final testing tasks T051-T058 can run in parallel

### Test-First Approach

- Fix failing tests first (T001-T007)
- Implement features with tests (T028-T031, T042-T045)
- Validate everything works (T051-T058)

3. **T008-T016**: Fix Firebase and Appium configuration

### Feature Implementation

1. **T017-T031**: Complete notification system
2. **T032-T045**: Complete thread management
3. **T046-T050**: Complete cross-platform testing

### Final Validation

1. **T051-T058**: Comprehensive testing
2. **T059-T063**: Documentation and cleanup

## Success Criteria

- **All Tests Passing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests must pass
- **No Firebase Errors**: Firebase error alerts must be resolved
- **Complete Phase 3.5**: All 6 sub-phases must be complete
- **App Stability**: App must be fully usable without bugs
- **Automated Testing**: Regression prevention must be working
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across web and mobile

---

## Notes

- **Test-First**: Fix failing tests before implementing new features
- **Firebase Priority**: Firebase import error blocks everything
- **Appium Focus**: E2E tests are critical for Phase 3.5 completion
- **Constitution Compliance**: All tasks include Memory Bank updates
- **Incremental**: Complete each sub-phase before moving to next
