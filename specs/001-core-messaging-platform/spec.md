# Feature Specification: Communexus Core Messaging Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-core-messaging-platform`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a production-quality messaging app designed for contractors and service business operators to centralize communication with clients, team members, and vendors. The app combines real-time chat infrastructure with AI-powered features for task extraction, priority detection, and decision tracking. The main purpose app is to be able to track communications with different parties, organize, centralize that information within other platforms later on. Example user story is contractor talking to worker and the worker sending pictures of the currents state of the project. The contractor should be easily able to find that information later on and have a single source of truth between him the workers and the client"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Project Communication Hub (Priority: P1)

**Contractor manages project communications across team and client**

A contractor needs to coordinate with workers, subcontractors, and clients on multiple job sites. They need a single place where all project-related communications are centralized, searchable, and organized by project context. When a worker sends photos of current project status, the contractor should be able to easily find this information later and share relevant updates with the client.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - centralized project communication that eliminates the chaos of scattered SMS, emails, and phone calls. Without this, contractors lose critical project information and context.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a project thread with 3+ participants (contractor, worker, client), exchanging messages and media, then searching for specific information. Delivers immediate value by organizing previously fragmented communications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contractor has created a project thread with worker and client, **When** the worker sends photos of current work progress, **Then** the contractor can view the photos and forward relevant ones to the client with context
2. **Given** multiple project threads exist, **When** the contractor searches for "tile installation photos", **Then** they find all relevant messages and media across all project threads
3. **Given** a project thread with ongoing communication, **When** the contractor needs to reference a previous decision about materials, **Then** they can quickly find and reference the specific message where the decision was made

### User Story 2 - AI-Powered Project Intelligence (Priority: P2)

**Contractor leverages AI to extract actionable insights from project communications**

A contractor receives dozens of messages daily across multiple projects. They need AI to automatically identify action items, track decisions, detect urgent issues, and summarize long conversation threads. This helps them stay on top of commitments and never miss critical project updates.

**Why this priority**: This differentiates Communexus from basic messaging apps and directly addresses the contractor's pain point of information overload. AI features provide immediate productivity gains and reduce missed tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a thread with 20+ messages containing various action items, decisions, and urgent issues, then using AI features to extract summaries, action items, and priority messages. Delivers value by automating information processing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project thread with 20+ messages about material delivery delays and schedule changes, **When** the contractor requests a thread summary, **Then** AI provides a structured summary with key decisions, action items, and unresolved issues
2. **Given** ongoing project communications, **When** a worker sends "URGENT: pipe leak in unit 5", **Then** the system automatically flags this as high priority and moves the thread to the top of the contractor's list
3. **Given** a conversation where client agreed to a price change, **When** the contractor marks this message as a decision, **Then** it's stored in a decisions tracker for future reference and dispute protection

### User Story 3 - Multi-Channel Integration (Priority: P3)

**Contractor receives communications from SMS, email, and in-app messages in unified threads**

A contractor's clients and workers use different communication channels - some prefer SMS, others email, some use the app directly. The contractor needs all these communications unified into single project threads, regardless of the original channel, so they have one source of truth for each project.

**Why this priority**: This enables the platform vision and solves the fragmentation problem completely. While Phase 1 focuses on in-app messaging, this sets up the architecture for multi-channel integration in Phase 3.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up SMS and email webhooks that route messages into existing project threads, then verifying that all participants see unified conversation history regardless of their preferred communication method.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project thread exists in the app, **When** a client sends an SMS about the project, **Then** the SMS appears in the same thread as in-app messages, and all participants can see the unified conversation
2. **Given** a contractor is working on multiple projects, **When** they receive an email from a client, **Then** the system automatically routes the email to the correct project thread based on context and participant matching
3. **Given** unified project threads with mixed channels, **When** the contractor searches for information, **Then** they find results across all channels (SMS, email, in-app) in a single search interface

### User Story 4 - Proactive Project Assistant (Priority: P3)

**Contractor receives proactive suggestions and automated follow-ups for project management**

A contractor juggles multiple projects with different timelines and commitments. They need an AI assistant that monitors project communications and proactively suggests follow-ups, drafts responses, and identifies when commitments need attention.

**Why this priority**: This is the advanced AI capability that scores high on the rubric. It demonstrates sophisticated AI integration and provides genuine value by preventing missed follow-ups and automating routine communication tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating project threads with various commitments and deadlines, then verifying that the AI assistant identifies follow-up needs and suggests appropriate actions without being asked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contractor promised to send a quote by Friday, **When** Friday arrives without the quote being sent, **Then** the AI assistant suggests drafting a quote reminder message and offers to generate a professional response
2. **Given** a client asked about project timeline 3 days ago, **When** the contractor hasn't responded, **Then** the AI assistant flags this as a missed follow-up and suggests drafting a status update
3. **Given** project communications contain scheduling requests, **When** a worker asks "Can you come Thursday at 2pm?", **Then** the AI assistant suggests adding this to calendar and drafting a confirmation message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a worker sends photos but the contractor is offline?
- How does the system handle duplicate messages from different channels?
- What if a client sends sensitive information that needs to be redacted?
- How does the system handle message delivery failures across channels?
- What happens when project participants change (worker leaves, new subcontractor joins)?
