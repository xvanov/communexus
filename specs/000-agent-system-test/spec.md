# Sample Test Feature

**Status**: Testing Agent System  
**Branch**: test/agent-feedback-environment  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

## Overview

This is a sample specification to test the agent feedback environment. It defines a simple task with basic tests to verify the orchestrator, environment manager, and test runners are working correctly.

## Tasks

### T001: Test Agent Environment Setup

**Description**: Verify that the agent feedback environment can start, run tests, and collect feedback correctly. This is a meta-test to validate the infrastructure.

**Appium Tests**:
- test-app-launches.js
- test-login-screen-visible.js

**Visual Checks** (Claude AI):
- "Is the Communexus logo visible on the screen?"
- "Is there a login form with email and password fields?"
- "Are there sign in and sign up buttons visible?"

**Multi-Device**: No

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Environment manager starts successfully
- [ ] Firebase emulators running
- [ ] iOS simulators boot correctly
- [ ] App installs on simulators
- [ ] Appium tests execute
- [ ] Visual checks execute (if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set)
- [ ] Feedback is collected and saved
- [ ] Test results are accurate

**Files to Modify**:
- None (this is a read-only test)

## Testing Strategy

### Appium Tests

**test-app-launches.js**:
```json
{
  "name": "App launches successfully",
  "steps": [
    { "action": "wait", "duration": 3000 }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    { "type": "elementVisible", "testID": "logo" }
  ]
}
```

**test-login-screen-visible.js**:
```json
{
  "name": "Login screen is visible",
  "steps": [
    { "action": "wait", "duration": 2000 }
  ],
  "assertions": [
    { "type": "elementVisible", "testID": "email-input" },
    { "type": "elementVisible", "testID": "password-input" }
  ]
}
```

### Integration Tests
None needed for this meta-test.

### E2E Tests
The entire agent orchestration loop is the E2E test.

## Success Metrics

- All scripts execute without errors
- Test results are collected
- Feedback is generated
- Environment cleans up properly

## Notes

- This test should pass without any code changes
- It validates the infrastructure is working
- Can be run repeatedly to test the system
- If ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set, visual checks will be skipped (expected)
