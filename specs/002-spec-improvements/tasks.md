# Tasks: Specification Quality Improvements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-spec-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No tests requested - this is a meta-specification improvement focused on documentation quality

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Documentation improvement**: `specs/001-core-messaging-platform/` (target for improvements)
- **Memory Bank**: `memory-bank/` (target for workflow integration)
- **Improvement specs**: `specs/002-spec-improvements/` (source of improvements)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Analysis before implementation
- Core improvements before validation
- Documentation updates after implementation
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tasks within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all AI service consolidation tasks together:
Task: "Identify duplicate AI requirements FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, FR-013 in specs/001-core-messaging-platform/spec.md"
Task: "Create consolidated AI service requirement FR-AI-001 in specs/001-core-messaging-platform/spec.md"
Task: "Define unified AI service interface specification in specs/001-core-messaging-platform/spec.md"
Task: "Specify consistent response format for all AI capabilities in specs/001-core-messaging-platform/spec.md"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (AI Service Consolidation)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (AI Service Consolidation)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Performance Criteria)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (Memory Bank Management)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (Edge Case Handling)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Phase Structure Alignment)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Constitution Compliance

**Memory Bank Management (Principle I - NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- ALL developers MUST read memory bank before starting any work
- ALL developers MUST update memory bank after completing work
- Memory Bank tasks (T036-T045) are mandatory
- No work begins without understanding current project state
- No work is complete without documenting changes and insights

**Test-Driven Development (Principle II)**:
- Focus on critical improvements that provide valuable feedback
- Each improvement must be independently testable
- Validation checklists serve as test criteria

**Simple Implementation Philosophy (Principle IV)**:
- Keep improvements simple and focused
- Avoid over-engineering specification changes
- Clear, actionable improvements only

**Atomic Development Workflow (Principle V)**:
- Each task addresses a single, atomic improvement
- Work structured to enable parallel development streams
- Independent improvements to avoid conflicts
- Incremental delivery of value
