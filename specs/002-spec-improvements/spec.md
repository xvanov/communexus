**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implmenet the recommended improvments"

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19

- Q: What specific performance measurement approach should be used for AI features? → A: Synthetic test data with predefined scenarios
- Q: What specific handling approach should be used for edge cases? → A: Fail-fast with clear error messages

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Consolidated AI Service Requirements (Priority: P1)

**Developer implements unified AI service architecture with clear, non-duplicated requirements**

A developer needs to implement AI features for the messaging platform but finds the current specification has duplicate and conflicting requirements for AI capabilities. They need a consolidated, unambiguous specification that clearly defines what AI services must provide without redundancy or confusion.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the HIGH severity duplication issue (A1) where FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, and FR-013 overlap. Without consolidation, developers will implement conflicting or redundant AI services, wasting development time and creating inconsistent user experiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing a single AI service that handles thread summarization, action extraction, priority detection, and proactive assistance through a unified interface. Delivers immediate value by eliminating requirement confusion and enabling consistent AI feature implementation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer reads the AI requirements, **When** they implement the AI service, **Then** they can build all AI features using a single, consistent interface without conflicting specifications
2. **Given** multiple AI features are implemented, **When** users interact with them, **Then** all AI responses follow the same format, error handling, and performance standards
3. **Given** the AI service specification, **When** developers implement new AI capabilities, **Then** they can extend the service without modifying existing requirements

### User Story 2 - Measurable Performance Criteria (Priority: P1)

**Developer implements AI features with specific, testable performance requirements**

A developer needs to implement AI features but finds vague performance requirements like "90%+ accuracy" and "95% missed follow-up detection" without specific measurement criteria. They need concrete, measurable performance standards that can be validated through testing.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the MEDIUM severity ambiguity issue (A2) where performance metrics lack specific measurement criteria. Without measurable criteria, developers cannot validate if their implementation meets requirements, and quality assurance cannot verify feature performance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing AI features and validating them against specific performance benchmarks using defined test datasets and measurement protocols. Delivers immediate value by enabling objective performance validation and preventing subjective quality assessments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AI features are implemented, **When** performance testing is conducted, **Then** specific accuracy metrics can be measured using synthetic test data with predefined scenarios
2. **Given** performance benchmarks are defined, **When** AI responses are generated, **Then** response times can be measured against specific targets (e.g., <5 seconds for thread summarization)
3. **Given** follow-up detection is implemented, **When** missed follow-ups are identified, **Then** detection accuracy can be measured using specific test scenarios and validation criteria

### User Story 3 - Complete Edge Case Handling (Priority: P2)

**Developer implements robust error handling and fallback behaviors for all edge cases**

A developer needs to implement messaging features but finds edge cases listed without specific handling requirements. They need detailed specifications for how the system should behave in error conditions, offline scenarios, and boundary cases to ensure reliable user experience.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the HIGH severity underspecification issue (A3) where edge cases lack specific handling requirements. Without detailed edge case handling, the system will have unpredictable behavior in error conditions, leading to poor user experience and potential data loss.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating each edge case scenario and verifying that the system responds with appropriate error handling, user feedback, and fallback behaviors. Delivers immediate value by ensuring system reliability and preventing user frustration from unexpected behaviors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a worker sends photos while contractor is offline, **When** the contractor comes online, **Then** photos are delivered with proper notification and the contractor can view them with context
2. **Given** duplicate messages arrive from different channels, **When** the system processes them, **Then** duplicates are detected and merged without creating confusion in the conversation
3. **Given** sensitive information is shared in a message, **When** the system processes it, **Then** appropriate security measures are applied and users are notified of any restrictions

---

### User Story 4 - Constitution-Compliant Development Workflow (Priority: P1)

**Developer follows Memory Bank Management requirements throughout development process**

A developer needs to implement features but finds that Memory Bank Management tasks are not properly integrated into the development workflow. They need clear guidance on when and how to read and update the memory bank to ensure project continuity and knowledge preservation.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the CRITICAL severity constitution alignment issue (A4) where Memory Bank Management tasks exist but are not properly integrated. This violates Principle I (NON-NEGOTIABLE) and could lead to knowledge loss and project discontinuity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having developers follow the Memory Bank Management workflow and verifying that all project context, decisions, and learnings are properly documented and accessible. Delivers immediate value by ensuring project continuity and preventing knowledge loss between development sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer starts a new task, **When** they begin work, **Then** they have read all memory bank files and understand the current project state
2. **Given** a developer completes a task, **When** they finish work, **Then** they have updated relevant memory bank files with changes, decisions, and learnings
3. **Given** multiple developers work on the project, **When** they switch contexts, **Then** they can rely on the memory bank for consistent project understanding

---

### User Story 5 - Aligned Phase Structure (Priority: P2)

**Developer follows consistent phase numbering and structure across all project documents**

A developer needs to implement features but finds inconsistent phase numbering between the specification (3 phases) and implementation plan (8 phases). They need aligned phase structure to avoid confusion about project progression and feature dependencies.

**Why this priority**: This addresses the MEDIUM severity inconsistency issue (A6) where different documents reference conflicting phase numbers. Without alignment, developers may implement features in the wrong order or miss critical dependencies.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that all project documents reference the same phase structure and that feature dependencies are correctly mapped across phases. Delivers immediate value by eliminating confusion and ensuring proper implementation sequencing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer reads the specification, **When** they reference the implementation plan, **Then** phase numbers and structure are consistent across both documents
2. **Given** features are implemented, **When** they are deployed, **Then** phase progression follows the aligned structure without conflicts
3. **Given** project documentation is updated, **When** phase references are made, **Then** all documents maintain consistent phase numbering

### Edge Cases

- What happens when AI service is unavailable during thread summarization request?
- How does the system handle performance measurement when test datasets are incomplete?
- What if Memory Bank files become corrupted or inaccessible during development?
- How does the system handle phase structure conflicts when multiple documents are updated simultaneously?
- What happens when edge case handling requirements conflict with performance requirements?
- How does the system handle developer workflow violations of Memory Bank Management?
- What if AI performance metrics cannot be measured due to insufficient test data?
- How does the system handle specification updates that invalidate existing implementations?
