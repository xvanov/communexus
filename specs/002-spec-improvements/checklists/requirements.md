# Specification Quality Checklist: Specification Quality Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Feature**: [specs/002-spec-improvements/spec.md](specs/002-spec-improvements/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification addresses all critical issues identified in analysis:
  - Consolidated AI service requirements (eliminates duplication)
  - Measurable performance criteria (eliminates ambiguity)
  - Complete edge case handling (eliminates underspecification)
  - Constitution-compliant workflow (addresses critical alignment issue)
  - Aligned phase structure (eliminates inconsistency)
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
