# Implementation Plan: Communexus Rubric Maximization

**Branch**: `003-rubric-maximization` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [specs/003-rubric-maximization/spec.md](specs/003-rubric-maximization/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-rubric-maximization/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Maximize MessageAI rubric scoring from current 47/100 points (Grade F) to 90+ points (Grade A) by implementing missing AI features, improving offline support, completing deployment, and delivering required submissions. Focus on the largest point gaps: AI features (30 points), offline support (6 points), deployment (2 points), and required deliverables (30 points).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, React Native (Expo SDK 54+), Node.js 20+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions, Auth, Storage, FCM), OpenAI GPT-4 API, LangChain  
**Storage**: Firebase Firestore (real-time), Expo SQLite (local cache), Firebase Storage (media)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Native Testing Library, Firebase Emulator Suite, GitHub Actions CI/CD  
**Target Platform**: iOS/Android via Expo Go, Firebase Cloud Functions  
**Project Type**: Mobile + Backend (React Native + Firebase)  
**Performance Goals**: <2s AI responses, 60fps scrolling, <2s app launch, sub-1s offline sync  
**Constraints**: Must achieve 90+ rubric points, all required deliverables, real device testing  
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ concurrent users, 5000+ messages, multi-project support  
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed                                | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because                             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-phase architecture   | Assignment requirements + platform vision | Single-phase insufficient for rubric scoring and long-term goals |
| AI integration complexity  | Required for 30 points on rubric          | Basic messaging alone insufficient for high score                |
| Offline-first architecture | Mobile app quality requirements           | Online-only fails offline testing scenarios                      |
