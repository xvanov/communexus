# Feature Specification: Communexus Rubric Maximization

**Feature Branch**: `003-rubric-maximization`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Current rubric score: 47/100 points (Grade F). Need to maximize points to achieve 90+ (Grade A) by implementing missing AI features, improving offline support, completing deployment, and delivering required submissions.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - AI Features Implementation (Priority: P1)

**Contractor leverages AI to maximize rubric scoring and productivity**

A contractor needs all 5 required AI features implemented and working excellently to achieve 14-15 points on the rubric. Currently scoring 0/15 points due to placeholder Cloud Functions. Must implement thread summarization, action item extraction, smart search, priority detection, and decision tracking with <2s response times and 90%+ accuracy.

**Why this priority**: This is the largest point gap (30 points total) and directly required for rubric scoring. Without these features, the app cannot achieve a passing grade.

**Independent Test**: Create thread with 20+ messages containing action items, decisions, and urgent issues, then use all 5 AI features to verify they work excellently with fast response times and high accuracy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project thread with 20+ messages about material delivery delays, **When** contractor requests thread summary, **Then** AI provides structured summary with key decisions, action items, and unresolved issues in <2 seconds
2. **Given** ongoing project communications, **When** worker sends "URGENT: pipe leak in unit 5", **Then** system automatically flags as high priority and moves thread to top of contractor's list
3. **Given** conversation where client agreed to price change, **When** contractor marks message as decision, **Then** it's stored in decisions tracker for future reference and dispute protection

### User Story 2 - Offline Support Excellence (Priority: P1)

**Contractor works seamlessly offline with complete message persistence**

A contractor needs excellent offline support to achieve 11-12 points on the rubric. Currently scoring 6/12 points due to incomplete offline implementation. Must implement complete offline queuing, sub-1 second sync, and all offline test scenarios.

**Why this priority**: This is a critical gap (6 points) and required for mobile app quality. Offline support is essential for contractors working in areas with poor connectivity.

**Independent Test**: Send 5 messages while offline → go online → all messages deliver in order. Force quit app mid-conversation → reopen → chat history intact. Network drop for 30s → auto-reconnect → seamless sync.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** contractor goes offline, **When** they send 5 messages, **Then** messages queue locally and send when reconnected with sub-1 second sync
2. **Given** contractor force-quits app mid-conversation, **When** they reopen app, **Then** full chat history is preserved and no messages are lost
3. **Given** network drops for 30+ seconds, **When** connectivity returns, **Then** app auto-reconnects with complete sync and clear UI indicators

### User Story 3 - Advanced AI Capability (Priority: P1)

**Contractor benefits from proactive AI assistant with LangChain**

A contractor needs an advanced AI capability to achieve 9-10 points on the rubric. Currently scoring 0/10 points due to placeholder LangChain function. Must implement proactive assistant that monitors conversations, triggers suggestions, and learns from user feedback.

**Why this priority**: This is a major point gap (10 points) and demonstrates sophisticated AI integration. Required for achieving excellent rubric scores.

**Independent Test**: Create project threads with various commitments and deadlines, then verify AI assistant identifies follow-up needs and suggests appropriate actions without being asked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** contractor promised to send quote by Friday, **When** Friday arrives without quote sent, **Then** AI assistant suggests drafting quote reminder message
2. **Given** client asked about project timeline 3 days ago, **When** contractor hasn't responded, **Then** AI assistant flags as missed follow-up and suggests status update
3. **Given** project communications contain scheduling requests, **When** worker asks "Can you come Thursday at 2pm?", **Then** AI assistant suggests adding to calendar and drafting confirmation
