# Tasks: Communexus Rubric Maximization

**Feature Branch**: `003-rubric-maximization` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Plan**: [specs/003-rubric-maximization/plan.md](specs/003-rubric-maximization/plan.md)
**Input**: Implementation plan from `/specs/003-rubric-maximization/plan.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Maximize MessageAI rubric scoring from current 47/100 points (Grade F) to 90+ points (Grade A) by implementing missing AI features, improving offline support, completing deployment, and delivering required submissions. Focus on the largest point gaps: AI features (30 points), offline support (6 points), deployment (2 points), and required deliverables (30 points).

## Dependencies

**Critical Path**: AI Features → Offline Support → Deployment → Deliverables → Performance → Technical Excellence

**Parallel Opportunities**: 
- AI features can be implemented in parallel
- Offline support can be implemented alongside AI features
- Deployment can be prepared while features are being implemented
- Deliverables can be created in parallel once features are complete
- Performance optimization can run alongside other features
- Technical excellence can be implemented in parallel

**Incremental Delivery**: Implement features incrementally with testing at each step to ensure quality.

**Parallel Execution**: Run AI features, offline support, and deployment preparation in parallel to maximize efficiency.

**Quality Gates**: Each phase must pass quality gates before proceeding to next phase.

**Testing Strategy**: Implement comprehensive testing for each feature to ensure reliability.

**Performance Focus**: Optimize performance throughout implementation to meet rubric targets.

**Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout implementation.

**Validation**: Validate rubric scoring at each phase to ensure progress toward 90+ points.

## Success Criteria

- **Phase 1-2**: Foundation complete, AI infrastructure ready, offline support ready, deployment ready
- **Phase 3-6**: All AI features implemented, offline support excellent, deployment complete, deliverables ready
- **Phase 7-10**: Performance optimized, UX excellent, mobile lifecycle handled, technical excellence achieved
- **Phase 11**: Final integration complete, documentation updated, ready for rubric evaluation
- **Final**: 90+ points on MessageAI rubric (Grade A), all deliverables submitted, app deployed and accessible
