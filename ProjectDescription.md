MessageAI
Building Cross-Platform Messaging Apps with AI Features

Background
WhatsApp transformed how billions communicate by making messaging fast, reliable, and secure. The app works seamlessly across mobile platforms, handles offline scenarios gracefully, and delivers messages instantly even on poor network connections.
What's remarkable is that WhatsApp was originally built by just two developers—Brian Acton and Jan Koum—in a matter of months. They created an app that would eventually serve over 2 billion users worldwide. With today's AI coding tools, you can absolutely build a production-quality messaging app in one week—and potentially take it even further than they initially did.
This required solving complex technical challenges: message persistence, real-time delivery, optimistic UI updates, efficient data sync, and cross-platform compatibility.
Now imagine adding AI to this. What if your messaging app could automatically summarize long conversation threads? Or translate messages in real-time? Or provide an AI agent that helps you draft responses, schedule messages, or extract action items from group chats?
This project challenges you to build both a production-quality messaging infrastructure—like WhatsApp—and AI features that enhance the messaging experience using LLMs, agents, and RAG pipelines.
Why This Matters
The future of messaging isn't just about sending texts—it's about intelligent communication. You'll be building the foundation for how AI can make conversations more productive, accessible, and meaningful.
Project Overview
This is a one-week sprint with three key deadlines:
MVP: Tuesday (24 hours)
Early Submission: Friday (4 days)
Final: Sunday (7 days)
You'll build in two phases: first the core messaging infrastructure with real-time sync and offline support, then AI features tailored to a specific user persona.
MVP Requirements (24 Hours)
This is a hard gate. To pass the MVP checkpoint, you must have:
One-on-one chat functionality
Real-time message delivery between 2+ users
Message persistence (survives app restarts)
Optimistic UI updates (messages appear instantly before server confirmation)
Online/offline status indicators
Message timestamps
User authentication (users have accounts/profiles)
Basic group chat functionality (3+ users in one conversation)
Message read receipts
Push notifications working (at least in foreground)
Deployment: Running on local emulator/simulator with deployed backend (TestFlight/APK/Expo Go if possible, but not required for MVP)
The MVP isn't about features—it's about proving your messaging infrastructure is solid. A simple chat app with reliable message delivery is worth more than a feature-rich app with messages that don't sync reliably.
Platform Requirements
Choose ONE of the following:
Swift (iOS native) - SwiftUI or UIKit
Kotlin (Android native) - Jetpack Compose or XML
React Native with Expo - Must use Expo Go or custom dev client
Core Messaging Infrastructure
Essential Features
Your messaging app needs one-on-one chat with real-time message delivery. Messages must persist locally—users should see their chat history even when offline. Support text messages with timestamps and read receipts.
Implement online/offline presence indicators. Show when users are typing. Handle message delivery states: sending, sent, delivered, read.
Include basic media support—at minimum, users should be able to send and receive images. Add profile pictures and display names.
Build group chat functionality supporting 3+ users with proper message attribution and delivery tracking.
Real-Time Messaging
Every message should appear instantly for online recipients. When users go offline, messages queue and send when connectivity returns. The app must handle poor network conditions gracefully—3G, packet loss, intermittent connectivity.
Implement optimistic UI updates. When users send a message, it appears immediately in their chat, then updates with delivery confirmation. Messages never get lost—if the app crashes mid-send, the message should still go out.
Testing Scenarios
We'll test with:
Two devices chatting in real-time
One device going offline, receiving messages, then coming back online
Messages sent while app is backgrounded
App force-quit and reopened to verify persistence
Poor network conditions (airplane mode, throttled connection)
Rapid-fire messages (20+ messages sent quickly)
Group chat with 3+ participants
Choose Your User Persona
You must build for ONE of these specific user types. Your AI features should be tailored to their needs.
For each persona, you must implement:

Service Business Operator	Independent property managers, landlords, or small-business contractors who coordinate with tenants, clients, and vendors through text, email, and phone.	"• Fragmented communication across SMS, email, and chat apps 
• Missed messages or decisions due to context overload 
• Manual follow-ups and lost task tracking 
• Difficulty organizing documentation and agreements"	"1. Thread Summarization: Condenses long tenant or client conversations into key points.
2. Action Item Extraction: Identifies to-dos such as “schedule plumber” or “collect rent.”
3. Smart Search: Retrieves any message or attachment by intent or keyword across all channels.
4. Priority Message Detection: Flags urgent issues (e.g., leaks, payment delays).
5. Decision Tracking: Records agreements or instructions for easy reference and dispute protection."	A) Proactive Assistant: Detects follow-up needs (e.g., rent reminders, maintenance confirmations) and automatically drafts or schedules responses.



AI Features Implementation
All AI features should be built using LLMs (like GPT-4 or Claude), function calling/tool use, and RAG pipelines for accessing conversation history. This is not about training ML models—it's about leveraging existing AI capabilities through prompting and tool integration.
Technical Implementation
AI Architecture Options:
Option 1: AI Chat Interface A dedicated AI assistant in a special chat where users can:
Ask questions about their conversations
Request actions ("Translate my last message to Spanish")
Get proactive suggestions
Option 2: Contextual AI Features AI features embedded directly in conversations:
Long-press message → translate/summarize/extract action
Toolbar buttons for quick AI actions
Inline suggestions as users type
Option 3: Hybrid Approach Both a dedicated AI assistant AND contextual features
AI Integration Requirements
The following agent frameworks are recommended:
AI SDK by Vercel - streamlined agent development with tool calling
OpenAI Agent SDK (Swarm) - lightweight multi-agent orchestration
LangChain - comprehensive agent framework with extensive tools
Your agent should have:
Conversation history retrieval (RAG pipeline)
User preference storage
Function calling capabilities
Memory/state management across interactions
Error handling and recovery
Technical Stack (Recommended)
The Golden Path: Firebase + Swift
Backend:
Firebase Firestore - real-time database
Firebase Cloud Functions - serverless backend for AI calls
Firebase Auth - user authentication
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) - push notifications
Mobile (iOS):
Swift with SwiftUI
SwiftData for local storage
URLSession for networking
Firebase SDK
Deploy via TestFlight
AI Integration:
OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude (called from Cloud Functions)
Function calling / tool use
AI SDK by Vercel or LangChain for agents
Why This Stack:
Firebase handles real-time sync out of the box
Cloud Functions keep API keys secure
SwiftUI is fastest for iOS development
Everything deploys easily
Alternative Paths
React Native:
Expo Router, Expo SQLite, Expo Notifications
Deploy via Expo Go
Still use Firebase backend
Android:
Kotlin with Jetpack Compose
Room Database
Firebase SDK
Deploy via APK
Other Backends:
AWS (DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, SNS)
Supabase (PostgreSQL, Realtime, Auth)
Build Strategy
Start with Messages First: Get basic messaging working end-to-end before anything else:
Send a text message from User A → appears on User B's device
Messages persist locally (works offline)
Messages sync on reconnect
Handle app lifecycle (background/foreground)
Only after messaging is solid should you add AI features.
Build Vertically: Finish one slice at a time. Don't have 10 half-working features.
Test on Real Hardware: Simulators don't accurately represent performance, networking, or app lifecycle. Use physical devices.
For AI Features:
Start with simple prompts, iterate to improve accuracy
Use RAG to give the LLM conversation context
Test with edge cases (empty conversations, mixed languages, etc.)
Cache common AI responses to reduce costs

Final Note
This project mirrors what the best AI communication startups are building right now—combining robust messaging infrastructure with intelligent AI features that genuinely help users.
Remember: WhatsApp was built by two developers in months. With modern AI coding tools, you can build something comparable in one week and push it even further with intelligent features that didn't exist back then.
The closer you get to that experience, the more you'll understand what it takes to build the next generation of messaging apps.
A simple, reliable messaging app with truly useful AI features beats any feature-rich app with flaky message delivery or gimmicky AI.
Build something people would actually want to use every day.
