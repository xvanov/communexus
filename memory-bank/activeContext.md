# Active Context: Communexus Phase 3 - Core Messaging (PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL)

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Phase 3 - User Story 1 (PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL ⚠️)  
**Next Phase**: Bug fixes and stabilization before Phase 4  
**Mode**: Bug fixing and stabilization  
**Status**: Core messaging functionality works (messages send between users), but app is almost unusable due to bugs

## Recent Changes

### Phase 3 Core Messaging Implementation (PARTIALLY COMPLETE ⚠️)

#### ✅ Working Features
- ✅ **Core Messaging**: Real-time messaging with Firestore listeners
- ✅ **Chat Screens**: ChatListScreen, ChatScreen, GroupCreateScreen
- ✅ **UI Components**: ThreadItem, MessageBubble, ChatInput
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Firebase Auth with sign-in/sign-up/logout
- ✅ **Test Users**: Built-in test user creation (a@test.com, b@test.com)
- ✅ **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen management
- ✅ **Firebase Emulators**: Local development environment configured
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on both mobile (Expo Go) and web
- ✅ **Message Sending**: Messages successfully send between users

#### ⚠️ Buggy Features (Almost Unusable)
- ⚠️ **Contacts System**: Automatic test user contacts with online status (bugs)
- ⚠️ **Thread Visibility**: Both users can see chats created by either user (inconsistent)
- ⚠️ **Firestore Security Rules**: Fixed to allow access by both UID and email (still has issues)
- ⚠️ **Thread Creation**: Inconsistent thread creation from contacts
- ⚠️ **Message Loading**: Infinite loading states in some scenarios
- ⚠️ **Contact Navigation**: Errors when clicking on contacts
- ⚠️ **Online Status**: Contact online/offline status not updating properly

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Firebase Permission Errors**: Still occurring despite rule fixes
2. **Thread Management**: Issues with thread creation and visibility
3. **Contact System**: Online status and contact management bugs
4. **Cross-Platform**: Web and mobile have different behaviors
5. **Error Handling**: Multiple Firebase permission and undefined errors
6. **App Usability**: Core messaging works but app is almost unusable

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Bug Fixing Priority)

1. **Fix Firebase Permission Errors**: Resolve remaining Firestore security rule issues
2. **Stabilize Thread Creation**: Ensure consistent thread creation from contacts
3. **Fix Contact Navigation**: Resolve errors when clicking on contacts
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Better error handling and user feedback
5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensure web and mobile behave identically
6. **Online Status Fix**: Proper online/offline status updates

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria (Not Yet Met)

- ❌ Stable messaging platform without critical bugs
- ❌ Reliable contact system and navigation
- ❌ Consistent cross-platform behavior
- ❌ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ❌ Usable app experience for testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **Mobile + Backend**: React Native + Firebase architecture working
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation between core engine, business logic, and UI
- **Future SDK Ready**: Structure designed for eventual SDK extraction

### Development Approach

- **Bug-First Development**: Focus on stability before new features
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure web and mobile work identically
- **User Experience**: App must be usable before adding AI features

### Technology Choices

- **React Native + Expo**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **Firebase**: For real-time backend services (working but buggy)
- **TypeScript Strict**: For type safety and maintainability
- **Firestore Security Rules**: Need refinement for test user scenarios

## Current Blockers

- **App Usability**: Core messaging works but app is almost unusable due to bugs
- **Thread Management**: Issues with thread creation and visibility
- **Contact System**: Online status and contact management bugs
- **Cross-Platform**: Web and mobile have different behaviors
- **Error Handling**: Multiple Firebase permission and undefined errors

## Risk Mitigation

- **Stability First**: Must fix bugs before Phase 4 (AI features)
- **User Experience**: App must be usable for testing and demos
- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure consistent behavior across platforms
- **Firebase Issues**: Resolve permission and security rule problems

## Success Metrics for Phase 3

- ✅ Messages successfully send between users
- ❌ Stable messaging platform without critical bugs
- ❌ Reliable contact system and navigation
- ❌ Consistent cross-platform behavior
- ❌ Usable app experience for testing
