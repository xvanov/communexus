# Active Context: Communexus Implementation Phase 1

## Current Work Focus

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup (COMPLETE âœ…)  
**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Foundational (Ready to begin)  
**Mode**: Strict TDD Protocol - Research â†’ Plan Test â†’ Write Test â†’ Write Code  
**Status**: Phase 1 complete - all setup tasks finished successfully

## Recent Changes

- âœ… **T001 Complete**: Created complete project structure with all required files
- âœ… **T002 Complete**: Expo SDK 54 working with mobile app functional
- âœ… **T003 Complete**: ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode configured
- âœ… **T004 Complete**: Firebase backend deployed with 7 Cloud Functions
- âœ… **T005 Complete**: Environment variables and .env.example configured
- âœ… **T006 Complete**: Git repository with comprehensive .gitignore
- âœ… **T007 Complete**: Folder structure matches architecture plan exactly
- âœ… **T008 Complete**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- ðŸŽ‰ **Phase 1 Complete**: All setup tasks finished successfully including CI/CD

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Phase 2 Start**: Begin foundational Firebase services
2. **T009**: Setup Firebase Firestore with security rules
3. **T010**: Implement Firebase Authentication (email/password + Google)
4. **T011**: Setup Firebase Cloud Functions structure and deployment
5. **T012**: Configure Firebase Storage rules for media uploads
6. **T013**: Create TypeScript interfaces for all data models
7. **T014**: Implement basic CRUD operations for core entities
8. **T015**: Setup Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications
9. **T016**: Configure Expo SQLite for local data persistence

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria

- âœ… Working Expo project that builds and runs
- âœ… Firebase project with all required services enabled
- âœ… Development environment ready for team collaboration
- âœ… Proper folder structure following architecture plan
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- **Mobile + Backend**: React Native + Firebase architecture chosen
- **Modular Structure**: Clear separation between core engine, business logic, and UI
- **Future SDK Ready**: Structure designed for eventual SDK extraction

### Development Approach

- **Strict TDD**: Following user's test-driven development protocol
- **Constitution Compliance**: All decisions must align with assignment-first development
- **Performance First**: Sub-200ms messaging, 60fps scrolling, <2s launch targets

### Technology Choices

- **React Native + Expo**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **Firebase**: For real-time backend services
- **TypeScript Strict**: For type safety and maintainability
- **Zustand + React Query**: For state management

## Current Blockers

- None - ready to begin implementation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Firebase Cold Start**: Will implement caching and pre-warming
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Will implement retry logic and rate limiting
- **Offline Sync Conflicts**: Will implement conflict resolution
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to Phase 1 requirements only

## Success Metrics for Phase 1

- All 7 setup tasks completed
- Project builds and runs successfully
- Firebase services configured and accessible
- Development environment ready for Phase 2 (Foundational)
