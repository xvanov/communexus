### Phase 3: User Story 1 - Project Communication Hub (MVP) ✅ PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

- ✅ **Core Messaging**: Real-time messaging with Firestore listeners
- ✅ **Chat Screens**: ChatListScreen, ChatScreen, GroupCreateScreen
- ✅ **UI Components**: ThreadItem, MessageBubble, ChatInput
- ✅ **Media Sharing**: Firebase Storage integration for images/documents
- ✅ **Message Search**: Basic text search across threads
- ✅ **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear immediately before server confirmation
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Firebase Auth with sign-in/sign-up/logout
- ✅ **Test Users**: Built-in test user creation (a@test.com, b@test.com)
- ✅ **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen management
- ✅ **Firebase Emulators**: Local development environment configured
- ✅ **TypeScript Models**: User, Thread, Message, Media interfaces
- ✅ **Message Status**: Sending/sent/delivered/read tracking
- ✅ **Timestamps**: Message creation and read timestamps
- ✅ **Username Display**: Current user shown in header
- ✅ **Logout Functionality**: Confirmation dialog and proper cleanup
- ✅ **Contacts System**: Automatic test user contacts with online status
- ✅ **Thread Visibility**: Both users can see chats created by either user
- ✅ **Firestore Security Rules**: Fixed to allow access by both UID and email
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on both mobile (Expo Go) and web

**CRITICAL STATUS**: Core messaging functionality works (messages send between users), but app is almost unusable due to bugs

## Current Status

### Implementation Phase

- **Current Phase**: Phase 3 - User Story 1 (PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL ⚠️)
- **Next Phase**: Bug fixes and stability improvements before Phase 4
- **Mode**: Bug fixing and stabilization
- **Progress**: Core messaging works but app has usability issues

### Next Milestones

1. **Phase 3 Complete**: ✅ Core messaging platform fully functional
2. **Phase 4 Complete**: AI-powered project intelligence features
3. **Assignment Submission**: 90+ rubric points achieved
4. **Platform Evolution**: Multi-channel integration and SDK extraction

## Known Issues

### Current Blockers

- **App Usability**: Core messaging works but app is almost unusable due to bugs
- **Thread Management**: Issues with thread creation and visibility
- **Contact System**: Online status and contact management bugs
- **Cross-Platform**: Web and mobile have different behaviors
- **Error Handling**: Multiple Firebase permission and undefined errors

### Critical Bugs Identified

1. **Firebase Permission Errors**: Still occurring despite rule fixes
2. **Thread Creation**: Inconsistent thread creation from contacts
3. **Message Loading**: Infinite loading states in some scenarios
4. **Contact Navigation**: Errors when clicking on contacts
5. **Online Status**: Contact online/offline status not updating properly
6. **Web vs Mobile**: Different behaviors between platforms

### Risk Areas

- **Firebase Cold Start**: AI features may exceed 5s response time
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Need retry logic and rate limiting
- **Offline Sync Conflicts**: Need conflict resolution strategy
- **Scope Creep**: Must maintain strict Phase 1 focus
- **Stability Issues**: App needs significant bug fixes before Phase 4

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets

- All 7 setup tasks completed
