## Current Status

### Implementation Phase
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup (5/7 tasks complete)
- **Current Task**: T003 - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode
- **Mode**: Strict TDD Protocol
- **Progress**: 71% Phase 1 complete, Firebase backend working

### Next Milestones
1. **Phase 1 Complete**: Working Expo project with Firebase setup
2. **Phase 2 Complete**: Foundation ready for user story implementation
3. **MVP Gate**: User Story 1 fully functional and testable
4. **Assignment Submission**: 90+ rubric points achieved

## Known Issues

### Current Blockers
- None - ready to begin implementation

### Risk Areas
- **Firebase Cold Start**: AI features may exceed 5s response time
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Need retry logic and rate limiting
- **Offline Sync Conflicts**: Need conflict resolution strategy
- **Scope Creep**: Must maintain strict Phase 1 focus

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets
- All 7 setup tasks completed
- Project builds and runs successfully
- Firebase services configured
- Development environment ready

### Overall Project Targets
- **MVP Gate**: All 10 core messaging features functional
- **Assignment**: 90+ rubric points, demo video complete
- **Platform**: Multi-channel integration working, SDK extractable

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- All code well-commented with TODO markers

### Testing Requirements
- Physical device testing required
- 2+ device validation for core features
- All user stories independently testable

### Performance Validation
- Sub-200ms message delivery
- 60 FPS scrolling performance
- <2 second app launch time
- <5 second AI response times
