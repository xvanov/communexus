## Current Status

### Implementation Phase

- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup (COMPLETE ✅)
- **Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Foundational (Ready to begin)
- **Mode**: Strict TDD Protocol
- **Progress**: Phase 1 complete (7/7 tasks), ready for Phase 2

### Next Milestones

1. **Phase 1 Complete**: Working Expo project with Firebase setup
2. **Phase 2 Complete**: Foundation ready for user story implementation
3. **MVP Gate**: User Story 1 fully functional and testable
4. **Assignment Submission**: 90+ rubric points achieved

## Known Issues

### Current Blockers

- None; moving to Phase 3 (User Story 1)

### Risk Areas

- **Firebase Cold Start**: AI features may exceed 5s response time
- **OpenAI Rate Limits**: Need retry logic and rate limiting
- **Offline Sync Conflicts**: Need conflict resolution strategy
- **Scope Creep**: Must maintain strict Phase 1 focus

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Targets

- All 7 setup tasks completed
- Project builds and runs successfully
- Firebase services configured
- Development environment ready

### Overall Project Targets

- **MVP Gate**: All 10 core messaging features functional
- **Assignment**: 90+ rubric points, demo video complete
- **Platform**: Multi-channel integration working, SDK extractable
